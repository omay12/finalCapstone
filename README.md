Introduction:

In this task, we explore the differences between various countries using
unsupervised learning methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
various clustering techniques

Dataset:

This dataset is from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kurohana/usarrets). A description of the
data is given as: “This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents,
for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the
percent of the population living in urban areas.”

How to install:
Download the file in the repo, and download the USA dataset, ensure both are in the same folder, and that you have navigated to this folder in your terminal.
Use a notebook such as Jupyter to run and read it.

How to use:
Opening the file with Jupyter will allow you to run through the PCA used on the dataset. One can see the different correlations and clustering performed in this PCA.
One can also alter the code and change features to utilise the project for their own analysis of data.
